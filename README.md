# Chess #

This project is for creating a working standard chess game that has a working chess engine (computer player). After that is done, we will try to make a working chess game (and maybe engines too) for various chess variants.

To try out this program, you can execute the runnable JAR file located in the root directory of this project.


### Building ###

To try it out, first download the repository as a zip file by clicking "Download ZIP" in the bottom right corner of the repository page. You can make a folder in your Eclipse workspace named "chess" or something you will remember. Then, copy the "src" folder into the folder. After you compile it the first time, copy the "Images" and "Fonts" folder into the "bin" folder that was automatically created for you. Now you should be able to try out the program by running from Eclipse.
